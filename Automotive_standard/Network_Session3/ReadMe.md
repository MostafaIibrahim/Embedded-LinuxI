Ethernet is a type of local area network (LAN) technology that allows devices to communicate with each other Ethernet uses a bus topology, where all devices are connected to a single cable Ethernet uses a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) protocol to manage data.
Ethernet is a shared medium, where all devices share the same bandwidth
Ethernet is a connectionless protocol, where data is sent without any guarantee of delivery
